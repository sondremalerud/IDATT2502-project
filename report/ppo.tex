\section{PPO}
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm developed by OpenAI which is designed for training agents driven by a reward to make decisions in a certain optimized way. Unlike DQN, PPO stores the experience only for a short amount of time and it is used to learn the neural network policy and then discarted, resulting in a probability distribution that we sample actions from for decision-making process. To ensure stability PPO uses so called “clipping” to prevend large policy updates.
